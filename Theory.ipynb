    "- **For transporters:** Prioritizes larger cavities with a 20% boost to consensus score for pockets over 300 units in size, consistent with the need for channel-like structures to transport molecules.\n",
    "- **For receptors:** Favors pockets with high druggability (>0.6) with a 15% boost to consensus score, aligning with ligand-binding properties of receptors.\n",

    "  - Retains only pockets in the highest-scoring cluster, reflecting the biological reality that true binding sites often have distinctly higher scores than false positives<sup>16</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fallback Statistical Filtering**\n",
    "  - Applied when clustering is not appropriate (fewer than 3 pockets) or when clustering fails.\n",
    "  - Uses Z-score normalization where pockets with Z-scores > 0 (above average) are retained<sup>18</sup>.\n",
    "  - Special handling for edge cases:\n",
    "    - When all scores are nearly identical, only the top-scoring pocket is retained.\n",
    "    - When all scores have below-average Z-scores, only the top-scoring pocket is kept.\n",
    "    - When only one pocket is found, it is automatically retained.\n",

    "## **Future Improvements**\n",
    "\n",
    "While our consensus-based approach to binding site prediction integrates multiple detection methods effectively, several improvements could enhance the reliability, accuracy, and reproducibility of the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Reproducibility Enhancements**\n",
    "\n",
    "The current implementation occassionally produces different results across multiple runs due to its reliance on random sampling. This affects the ray directions used in concavity assessment, grid point sampling in energy-based detection, and the initialization in DBSCAN clustering. Implementing a fixed seed for random number generation or replacing random sampling with deterministic uniform grids would create more consistent predictions that researchers could reproduce exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Geometric Detection Improvements**\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometric detection methods could benefit substantially from mathematical advancements. Rather than using grid-based cavity detection, alpha shapes would provide mathematically rigorous definitions of protein surfaces and cavities<sup>19</sup>.\n",
    "This approach would be less sensitive to grid resolution and orientation issues. Additionally, conducting detecting at multiple probe radii simultaneously (such as 1.4Ã…, 1.8Ã…, and 2.2Ã…) would identify pockets of various sizes and depths in a single pass, eliminating the current stepwise fallback mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Energy-Based Detection Refinements**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our energy-based detection uses simplified calculations for hydrophobicity and electrostatics. Integrating established molecular mechanisms force fields from libraries like Amber would significantly improve physicochemical evaluations<sup>20</sup>.\n",
    "Computational solvent mapping with multiple probe types (hydrophobic, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and charged probes) would provide a more nuanced identification of binding hotspots across different interaction types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Evolutionary Conservation Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most impactful addition would be evolutionary conservation analysis. Functionally important regions in proteins tend to be conserved across species, and binding sites are no exception. Integrating multiple sequence alignment analysis to identify conserved residues would add a powerful biological dimension to our predictions, particularly for enzymes where active sites show strong conservation patterns<sup>1, 13</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Machine Learning Integration**\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning presents another promising frontier. Our current rule-based scoring system could be supplemented or replaced by supervised models trained on known protein-ligand complexes. A classifier using features like geometric properties, physicochemical characteristics, residue composition, and conservation scores would likely outperform our current heuristic approach. More ambitious implementations might employ 3D convolutional neural networks or graph neural networks to capture the complex spatial relationships within binding pockets<sup>12, 16</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Constraints**\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these promising directions, we have deliberately maintained our current approach for several compelling reasons. The primary consideration is computational efficiency and accessibility. Many of the proposed improvements Ì£(particularly force field integration, evolutionary analysis, and machine learning implementations) would drastically increase computational requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current implementation also prioritizes interpretability. Each detection method and scoring component follows explainable biological and chemical principles that researchers can understand and trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, maintaining software dependencies at a manageable level ensures broader adoption and easier maintenance. Integrating specialized libraries for alpha shapes, force fields, or evolutionary analysis would add subtantial dependencies that could create compatibility issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, our current approach already achieves a quite well performance on some protein structures through its consensus methodology. The enhancements described represent refinements rather than fundamental redesigns, suggesting we have reached a favorable balance between accuracy, speed, and usability for applications in binding site prediction."
