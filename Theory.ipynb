    "The software combines several complementary approaches to identify potential binding sites in protein structures[¹]:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Geometric-Based Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is based on the physical shape of proteins and identifies concave regions or cavities that could accommodate ligands. The theoretical foundation includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1. Cavity Detection[¹^,²^,³]: Proteins often have cavities, clefts, or pockets on their surface where ligands can bind. The algorithm identifies these by:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Creating a 3D grid around the protein.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Identifying points that are inside the protein but not too close to any atom (probe_radius < distance < 4.0Å).\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Using ray-casting to determine if a point is enclosed by protein atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Clustering identified points to find distinct cavities.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2. Surface Analysis[²^,⁴]: When cavities aren't detected, the algorithm switches to analyzing the protein surface by:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Using DSSP (Define Secondary Structure of Proteins) to calculate accessible surface area.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Identifying surface atoms through relative accessibility threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Using a distance-based approach when DSSP fails (atoms with fewer neighbors are likely on the surface).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Energy-Based Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach considers the physicochemical properties of protein regions, focusing on:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Hydrophobicity: Binding sites often have a hydrophobic core that provides favorable interactions with ligands. The code uses the Kyte & Doolittle hydrophobicity scale to assess this property.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Electrostatics: The distribution of charged and polar residues influences ligand binding. The algorithm assigns charges to residues and calculates distance-weighted charge distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Energy Scoring: Combines hydrophobicity and electrostatic properties to identify regions with favorable energy profiles for binding[³^,⁴].\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Knowledge-Based Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This method incorporates empirical observations about the composition of known binding sites:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Residue Composition: Binding sites typically have a mix of hydrophobic and polar/charged residues[⁵].\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Catalytic Patterns: Specific residue pairs (like His-Asp, Ser-His) are common in enzyme active sites[⁶].\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Binding Site Specialization: Different types of binding sites (heme-binding, nucleotide-binding, metal-binding) have characteristic residue patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Catalytic Triads: Specific arrangements of residues (like Ser-His-Asp) common in certain enzyme classes[⁶].\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Consensus Approach[¹^,³]\n",
    "\n",
    "The core theoretical concept is that combining multiple detection methods improves accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Different methods may detect the same binding site, increasing confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Methods are complementary (geometric focuses on shape, energy on chemical properties).\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Consensus scoring reduces false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Druggability Assessment[³]\n",
    "\n",
    "After potential binding sites are identified, they're evaluated for \"druggability\" (likelihood of binding drug-like molecules):\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Volume Analysis: Optimal binding pockets have volumes in the range of 200-800Å³.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Hydrophobic/Hydrophilic Balance: Druggable pockets typically have a balanced composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Enclosure: Well-enclosed pockets that protect ligands from solvent are more druggable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical strength of this approach lies in its multi-faceted assessment, combining physical, chemical, and statistical information to identify and rank potential binding sites that would be most suitable for drug design or understanding protein function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scoring system in this code implements a sophisticated approach to identify and prioritize protein binding sites that combines multiple scientific principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Protein-type specific adjustments: The system recognizes that different classes of proteins have different binding site characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * For enzymes, it boosts sites with catalytic residue patterns, reflecting the importance of specific amino acid arrangements in enzymatic function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * For transporters, it prioritizes larger cavities (>300 units), consistent with the need for channel-like structures to transport molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * For receptors, it favors moderately hydrophobic pockets with high druggability, aligning with ligand-binding properties of receptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multi-factor scoring formula: The final score combines:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Consensus score (weighted 3.0x) - representing agreement across prediction methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Knowledge/druggability score (weighted 0.5x) - representing prior knowledge about binding potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Statistical filtering approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Primary method: Hierarchical clustering using Ward's method to identify natural breaks in the data (similar to Jenks Natural Breaks optimization). The algorithm dynamically determines the optimal number of clusters (2-4) based on score separation. Only pockets in the highest-scoring cluster are retained, reflecting the biological reality that true binding sites often have distinctly higher scores than false positives[⁷].\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Fallback statistical filtering: For smaller datasets or when clustering fails, it uses Z-score normalization. Pockets with Z-scores > 0 (above average) are retained. This approach handles the common case where true binding sites are statistical outliers compared to background noise[⁸].\n",
    "\n",
    "The scoring system is particularly elegant because it adapts to different protein types and automatically determines significance thresholds from the data itself, rather than using arbitrary cutoffs. This approach matches the biological reality that binding site characteristics vary considerably across protein families.\n",
